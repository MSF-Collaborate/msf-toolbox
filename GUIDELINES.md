### General Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Follow the established conventions throughout the project to ensure consistency across all classes and methods.
2. **Documentation**: Document each class and method with clear and concise comments, including purpose, parameters, return values, and examples where applicable.
3. **Generalisability**: Remove components specific to your organisation and focus on contributing features which can be useful to a range of users.
3. **Testing**: Where possible, write unit tests for each class and method to ensure they work as expected and to facilitate future changes.

### Class Naming Conventions

1. **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the class.
2. **PascalCase**: Use PascalCase for class names.
3. **Prefix/Suffix**: We use a consistent suffix `Client` .
4. **Avoid Abbreviations**: Unless they are widely recognized and unambiguous.

**Example**: `DHIS2MetadataClient`, `ReliefWebClient`, `GDELTClient`.

### Method Naming Conventions

1. **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive and action-oriented names for methods that clearly indicate their functionality.
2. **snake_case**: Use snake_case for method names.
3. **Verb-Noun Structure**: Start with a verb to indicate the action. Commonly used in this project:
- add
- check
- configure
- delete
- download
- get
- list
- update
- upload
4. **Consistency**: Use consistent naming for similar methods across different classes.

**Example**: `list_reports`, `get_report`.

### Standardized Method Functionality

1. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling strategies, using exceptions where appropriate.
2. **Return Values**: Clearly define and document the return values for each method. Use standardized data structures where possible. Use JSON or JSON array where possible.
3. **Parameter Validation**: Validate authentication parameters in the class initialisation and validate input parameters and provide meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.

### Adding New Classes

1. **Purpose Definition**: Clearly define the purpose of the class before implementation.
2. **Interface Design**: Design a clear and concise interface for the class, focusing on the primary functionalities it should provide.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Ensure that each class has a single responsibility and that its methods are cohesive.

### Documentation and Comments

1. **Class-Level Comments**: Provide a brief description of the class, its purpose, and any important details.
2. **Method-Level Comments**: Document each method with its purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions.
3. **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments to explain complex logic or important details.

### Version Control

1. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive branch names that indicate the feature or fix (e.g., `feature/dhis2-api-client`).
- feature/
- improvement/
2. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made.
3. **Pull Requests**: Use pull requests for code reviews and ensure that all tests pass before merging. Resolve errors from SonarCloud
