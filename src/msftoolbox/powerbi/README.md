## Usage

### Connecting to the Power BI REST API
To connect to the Power BI REST API, you need to have a Microsoft account that has access to Power BI and an Azure AD application. With all that, you can connect to the Power BI REST API using the following function:

```python
from power_bi_client import PowerBIClient

client = PowerBIClient(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    username="your-username",
    password="your-password",
    tenant_id="your-tenant-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret"
)
```
